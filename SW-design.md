## Software Design Pattern

## Programming Paradigms

- [Wiki](https://bre.is/fT73yFJo3)
- a fundamental style of computer programming, a way of building the structure and elements of computer programs.
- [Functional Programming](https://bre.is/4iR1e7poQ): treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.
- [Data-driven programming](https://bre.is/EcuAALadI): the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of steps to be taken.
- [Aspect-oriented programming](https://bre.is/PjeYXlRoW)

## SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)

> software architecture design pattern based on discrete pieces of software providing application functionality as services to other applications.

- [Wiki](https://bre.is/q3GH59Mg5)
- WHY? to allow users to combine together fairly large chunks of functionality to form ad hoc applications built almost entirely from existing and fairly simple software services.
- reusable service <-> data with protocol <-> reusable service
- WSDL (Web Services Description Language) https://bre.is/nGsl1hr_L
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) https://bre.is/zEWEa-c-p
- REST (Representational State Transfer) https://bre.is/omETGpZlG

## Microservices (Modular Services)

> a software architecture design pattern, in which complex applications are composed of small, independent processes communicating with each other using language-agnostic APIs. These services are small, highly decoupled and focus on doing a small task

- Pros: fault tolerant, small, easy decoupling, resume-driven development
- Cons: data consistency
- WHY: continuous delivery with easy replacing processes
- WHAT: a software architecture method, a group of small & independent processes
- HOW (WHO / WHEN / WHERE): processes communicate with each other via language-independent APIs.
- should embrace automation of deployment and testing, and failure-tolerance

## Things to consider

- [Imperative](https://bre.is/ixdwVtnhj) vs [Functional](https://bre.is/qpS9VbOd-) vs [Declarative](https://bre.is/WZzH0qEUq)
- [Closure](https://bre.is/E41T5H56X)
- [Serialization](https://bre.is/fCvunRuRW)
- [Polymorphism](https://bre.is/La88yb5th)
