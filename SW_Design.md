# Software Design Pattern:
- https://goo.gl/4RGWB

# Programming Paradigms
- http://goo.gl/20AE
- a fundamental style of computer programming, a way of building the structure and elements of computer programs.
- Functional Programming http://goo.gl/MujI
	- treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.
- Data-driven programming http://goo.gl/yCC5p
	- the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of steps to be taken.
- Aspect-oriented programming

# SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)
-  http://goo.gl/i0NcbA
- software architecture design pattern based on discrete pieces of software providing application functionality as services to other applications.
- WHY? to allow users to combine together fairly large chunks of functionality to form ad hoc applications built almost entirely from existing and fairly simple software services.
- reusable service <<==>> data with protocol <<==>> reusable service
- WSDL (Web Services Description Language) http://goo.gl/laPc
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) http://goo.gl/24n7k3
- REST (Representational State Transfer) http://goo.gl/ipilt


# Microservices, Modular Services
- a software architecture design pattern, in which complex applications are composed of small, independent processes communicating with each other using language-agnostic APIs. These services are small, highly decoupled and focus on doing a small task
- Pros: fault tolerant, small, easy decoupling, resume-driven development
- Cons: data consistency
- WHY: continuous delivery with easy replacing processes
- WHAT: a software architecture method, a group of small & independent processes
- HOW (WHO / WHEN / WHERE):
			§ processes communicate with each other via language-independent APIs.
should embrace automation of deployment and testing, and failure-tolerance


# Things to consider:
- Imperative vs Functional / Declarative
- Closure http://goo.gl/MCMNE
- Serialization
- Polymorphism http://goo.gl/9rvKU
