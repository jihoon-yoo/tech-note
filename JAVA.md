Scala
- __Full support for functional programming__
- very strong static type system
- source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine.
- __Cloud computing__: Two significant open source cluster computing solutions are based on Scala: Apache Spark and Apache Ignite (adapted from the commercial GridGain product). Additionally, Apache Kafka, the publish-subscribe message queue popular with Spark and other stream processing technologies, is written in Scala.
