## Machine Learning

### TensorFlow

- Open-source, machine learning framework
- To implement ML & Deep Learning systems
- To allow a computer to learn how to spot complex patterns and/or to make best possible decisions
- A library for dataflow programming
- Key features:
- Math. expressions efficiency
- Deep neural networks and ML concepts
- GPU/CPU computing support
- High scalability of computation
- [home](https://www.tensorflow.org)

### ML Algorithms

- [KDnuggets](https://t.ly/mW7Nq)
- to find out the underlying relationship within data.
- the outcome of a ML algorithm is "ML model," which can be considered as a function: with different data set, the function could be changed.
